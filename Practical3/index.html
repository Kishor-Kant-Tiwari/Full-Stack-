      <h2>About Course</h2>
      <p>
        Full-stack developers are experts in both the frontend and backend; so, the full-stack of technology that makes up a website. They are proficient in both frontend and backend languages and frameworks, as well as in server, network and hosting environments.To get to this breadth and depth of knowledge, most full-stack developers will have spent many years working in a variety of different roles. They also tend to be well-versed in both business logic and user experience, meaning they are not only well-equipped to get hands on, but can also guide and consult on strategy too.
